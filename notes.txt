stokes and airy theory

airy theory is good for low amplitude vs wave length and depth (offshore inc.
non-local big swell)
	linear wave theory

if the height of a wave is 1/7th the lenght of a wave, it will break

ocillatory wave: Lw/d=16.4 (looks like a sine wave)

solitary wave: Lw/d=infinite and Hw/d=0.479                (0.479 = 1/7)

cnoidal wave: Lw/d=16.4 and Hw/d=0.497

Wave steepness = Hw/Lw

Hw = wave height
Lw = wave length
Tw = wave period = ~= 0.8 srt(Lw)
circular wave frequency = omega = 2 * pi / Tw (rad/s) = 2 * pi f = 1 / Tw
wave number = k = 2 * pi / Lw (rad/m) = omega^2 / g
wave celerity (phase velocity) = c = Lw / Tw = g / omega = srt(g / k)
tangential velocity = Vt = 0.5*Hw*omega

because larger waves travel faster, the largest waves arrive at the beach first.
	this is calles the normal dispersion of waves


stokes theory is good for high amplitude vs wave length and dept (coastal or
storm swell)
	nonlinear wave theory
